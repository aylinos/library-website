# Library-Website: Website for a library
Project in semester 2. Finished development on 7 May 2020. Pair work


Goal:
Develop full stack website using Pure CSS, JavaScript, PHP & MySQL database. Intro to MVC


Idea:
Through the website people will be able to view information about the library such as address and work hours, look at the set of books, keep track of public activities like group reading and other events, and most importantly reserve books remotely, if registered. Website visitors with no registration or without being logged in will be able to view all books in the library with detailed information and resume for each book. An important featureis displaying whether a given book is taken or is waiting to be.


Key implementations:
* Multi role authentication
* Remember me
* View library address and contact (Google maps)
* CRUD books & public activities
* Image upload
* Reserve book
